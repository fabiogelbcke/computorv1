# computorv1
ComputorV1 project for 42

Goal of the project is to solve 0th, 1st and 2nd degree equations.

- Show reduced equation
- Show discriminant if 2nd degree
- No math libraries allowed
- Show complex solutions if discriminant < 0

Since I was in a hurry I did the sqrt function with a divide and conquer algorithm (fuck speed, it's just a sqrt anyway :p)
